Basically... If you make boards for yourself: great, make boards for your friends: great, but **please do not sell hundreds on them on Aliexpress**. I'm selling boards [here](https://shop.rootkitlabs.com/products/flipper-blackhat); the money made here goes back into this project and other similar open-source projects!
